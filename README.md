## Overview  
This project simulates a **self-driving car using pure JavaScript (no libraries)**. It implements **AI-based decision-making** to navigate roads and obstacles.  

### **Key Features**  
- **ðŸš€ No Libraries!** Built with **Vanilla JavaScript** (No external frameworks).  
- **ðŸ§  AI-Powered** Uses a **neural network** for self-driving logic.  
- **ðŸŽ¨ Visual Simulation** Dynamic road, car movement, and real-time sensors.

## **Project Structure**  
- **index.html** â†’ UI for the self-driving car simulation.  
- **car.js** â†’ Defines the `Car` class, handling movement and AI-based navigation.  
- **controls.js** â†’ Manages user input (keyboard controls).  
- **network.js** â†’ Implements a simple **neural network** to drive the car.  
- **road.js** â†’ Defines road structure, lanes, and obstacles.  
- **sensor.js** â†’ Simulates car sensors to detect obstacles.  
- **utils.js** â†’ Contains helper functions for calculations.  
- **visualizer.js** â†’ Renders the car, road, and simulation elements.

## **How to Use**  
1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/jyothiprasannakambam/self-driving-car-js.git
   cd self-driving-car-js
   ```
2. **Open `index.html` in your browser**.  
3. **Adjust settings** (e.g., number of cars, mutation rate).  
4. **Observe the car driving autonomously!** ðŸš—
